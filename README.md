This project is a basic recipe website. It has a home page and multiple recipe pages. All the recipe pages are linked to the home page. Each recipe page contains details about the recipe and steps to prepare the recipe.

Through this project I demonstrated fundamental HTML skills like headings, images, links, lists and paragraphs.
